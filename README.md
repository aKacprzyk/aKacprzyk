## Hello there 👋, my name is Aleksandra Kacprzyk.

#### About me:
I'm a master student, who just entered the world of Big Data. My goal is to learn and to experience as much as possible.
I first stared codeing in R. At that time most of project focused on data visualisation, prognoses or simply creating models to understand problems or existing mechanisms. This year I started learning python and Apache PySpark. Right now I'm still exploring Python, however I also took first steps into coding in SAS.

####Bullet points:
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python, Apache Spark and SAS
- 🖥 I'm mostly code in R and Python.
